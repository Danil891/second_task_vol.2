1 I'm something weak
1 You got me begging, begging
1 I'm on my knees
5 I don't wanna be needing your love
2 I jUst wanna be deep in your love
1 And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby
1 'Cause I really don't care where you are
1 I just wanna be there where you are
3 And I gotta get one LITTLE taste
