1 I'm something weak
1 You got me begging, begging
1 I'm on my knees
3 I don't wanna be needing your love
2 i dOn't waNNa be needing your love
1 I jUst wanna be deep in your love
1 I just wanna be deep in your love
1 And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby
1 'Cause I really don't care where you are
1 I just wanna be there where you are
1 And I gotta get one LITTLE taste
2 And I gotta get one little taste
