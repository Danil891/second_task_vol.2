I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging
I'm on my knees
I don't wanna be needing your love
I don't wanna be needing your love
I don't wanna be needing your love
i dOn't waNNa be needing your love
i dOn't waNNa be needing your love
I jUst wanna be deep in your love
I just waNNa be deep in your lOve
And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one LITTLE taste
And I gotta get one little taste
And I gotta get one little taste
